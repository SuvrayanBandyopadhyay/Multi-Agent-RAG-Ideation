      " Overview   \n",
      "Swarm focuses on making agent coordination and execution lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable.\n",
      "It accomplishes this through two primitive abstractions: Agents and handoffs. An Agent encompasses instructions and tools, and can at any point choose to hand off a conversation to another Agent.\n",
      "These primitives are powerful enough to express rich dynamics between tools and networks of agents, allowing you to build scalable, real-world solutions while avoiding a steep learning curve.\n",
      " Note Swarm Agents are not related to Assistants in the Assistants API. They are named similarly for convenience, but are otherwise completely unrelated. Swarm is entirely powered by the Chat Completions API and is hence stateless between calls.\n",
      " Why Swarm   \n",
      "Swarm is lightweight, scalable, and highly customizable by design. It is best suited for situations dealing with a large number of independent capabilities and instructions that are difficult to encode into a single prompt.\n",
      "The Assistants API is a great option for developers looking for fully-hosted threads and built in memory management and retrieval. However, Swarm is optimal for developers who want full transparency and fine-grained control over context, steps, and tool calls. Swarm runs (almost) entirely on the client and, much like the Chat Completions API, does not store state between calls.\n",

      " Running Swarm   \n",
      "Start by instantiating a Swarm client (which internally just instantiates an OpenAI client).\n",
      " \n",
      "() \n",
      "  client.run()    \n",
      "Swarm's run() function is analogous to the chat.completions.create() function in the Chat Completions API – it takes messages and returns messages and saves no state between calls. Importantly, however, it also handles Agent function execution, hand-offs, context variable references, and can take multiple turns before returning to the user.\n",
      "At its core, Swarm's client.run() implements the following loop:\n",
      "Get a completion from the current Agent\n",
      "Execute tool calls and append results\n",
      "Switch Agent if necessary\n",
      "Update context variables, if necessary\n",
      "If no new function calls, return\n",
      " Arguments   \n",
      "Once client.run() is finished (after potentially multiple calls to agents and tools) it will return a Response containing all the relevant updated state. Specifically, the new messages, the last Agent to be called, and the most up-to-date context_variables. You can pass these values (plus new user messages) in to your next execution of client.run() to continue the interaction where it left off – much like chat.completions.create(). (The run_demo_loop function implements an example of a full execution loop in /swarm/repl/repl.py.)\n",
      "  Response Fields   \n",
      " Agents   \n",
      "An Agent simply encapsulates a set of instructions with a set of functions (plus some additional settings below), and has the capability to hand off execution to another Agent.\n",
      "While it's tempting to personify an Agent as \"someone who does X\", it can also be used to represent a very specific workflow or step defined by a set of instructions and functions (e.g. a set of steps, a complex retrieval, single step of data transformation, etc). This allows Agents to be composed into a network of \"agents\", \"workflows\", and \"tasks\", all represented by the same primitive.\n",
      "  Agent Fields   \n",
      " Instructions   \n",
      " Agent instructions are directly converted into the system prompt of a conversation (as the first message). Only the instructions of the active Agent will be present at any given time (e.g. if there is an Agent handoff, the system prompt will change, but the chat history will not.)\n",
      "  (\n",
      ") \n",
      "The instructions can either be a regular str, or a function that returns a str. The function can optionally receive a context_variables parameter, which will be populated by the context_variables passed into client.run().\n",

      "  OpenAI has unveiled “Swarm,” an experimental framework designed to orchestrate networks of AI agents. This unexpected release has ignited intense discussions among industry leaders and AI ethicists about the future of enterprise automation, despite the company’s emphasis that Swarm is not an official product.\n",
      "Swarm provides developers with a blueprint for creating interconnected AI networks capable of communicating, collaborating, and tackling complex tasks autonomously. While the concept of multi-agent systems isn’t new, Swarm represents a significant step in making these systems more accessible to a broader range of developers.\n",
      " (credit: x.com/shyamalanadkat) \n",
      " The next frontier in enterprise AI: Multi-agent systems and their potential impact \n",
      "The framework’s potential business applications are extensive. A company using Swarm-inspired technology could theoretically create a network of specialized AI agents for different departments. These agents might work together to analyze market trends, adjust marketing strategies, identify sales leads, and provide customer support—all with minimal human intervention.\n",
      "This level of automation could fundamentally alter business operations. AI agents might handle tasks currently requiring human oversight, potentially boosting efficiency and freeing employees to focus on strategic initiatives. However, this shift prompts important questions about the evolving nature of work and the role of human decision-making in increasingly automated environments.\n",
      " Navigating the ethical minefield: Security, bias, and job displacement in AI networks \n",
      "Swarm’s release has also rekindled debates about the ethical implications of advanced AI systems. Security experts stress the need for robust safeguards to prevent misuse or malfunction in networks of autonomous agents. Concerns about bias and fairness also loom large, as decisions made by these AI networks could significantly impact individuals and society.\n",
      "The specter of job displacement adds another layer of complexity. The potential of technologies like Swarm to create new job categories contrasts with fears that it may accelerate white-collar automation at an unprecedented pace. This tension highlights the need for businesses and policymakers to consider the broader societal impacts of AI adoption.\n",
      "Some developers have already begun exploring Swarm’s potential. An open-source project called “OpenAI Agent Swarm Project: Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarms (HOS)” demonstrates a possible implementation, including a hierarchy of AI agents with distinct roles and responsibilities. While intriguing, this early experiment also underscores the challenges in creating effective governance structures for AI systems.\n",
      " From experiment to enterprise: The future of AI collaboration and decision-making \n",
      "OpenAI has been clear about Swarm’s limitations. Shyamal Anadkat, a researcher at the company, stated on Twitter: “Swarm is not an official OpenAI product. Think of it more like a cookbook. It’s experimental code for building simple agents. It’s not meant for production and won’t be maintained by us.”\n",
      " \n",
      "https://twitter.com/shyamalanadkat/status/1844934179013919085\n",
      " \n",
      "This caveat tempers expectations and serves as a reminder that multi-agent AI development remains in its early stages. However, it doesn’t diminish Swarm’s significance as a conceptual framework. By providing a tangible example of how multi-agent systems might be structured, OpenAI has given developers and businesses a clearer vision of potential future AI ecosystems.\n",
      "For enterprise decision-makers, Swarm serves as a catalyst for forward-thinking. While not ready for immediate implementation, it signals the direction of AI technology’s evolution. Companies that begin exploring these concepts now—considering both their potential benefits and challenges—will likely be better positioned to adapt as the technology matures.\n",
      "Swarm’s release also emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in navigating the complex landscape of advanced AI. Technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and business leaders must work together to ensure that the development of multi-agent AI systems aligns with societal values and needs.\n",
      "The conversation around AI will increasingly focus on these interconnected systems. Swarm offers a valuable preview of the questions and challenges that businesses and society will face in the coming years.\n",
      "The tech world now closely watches to see how developers will build upon the ideas presented in Swarm, and how OpenAI and other leading AI companies will continue to shape the trajectory of this transformative technology.\n",

      "OpenAI Five is a computer program by OpenAI that plays the five-on-five video game  Dota 2 . Its first public appearance occurred in 2017, where it was demonstrated in a live one-on-one game against the professional player Dendi, who lost to it. The following year, the system had advanced to the point of performing as a full team of five, and began playing against and showing the capability to defeat professional teams.\n",
      " By choosing a game as complex as  Dota 2  to study machine learning, OpenAI thought they could more accurately capture the unpredictability and continuity seen in the real world, thus constructing more general problem-solving systems. The algorithms and code used by OpenAI Five were eventually borrowed by another neural network in development by the company, one which controlled a physical robotic hand. OpenAI Five has been compared to other similar cases of artificial intelligence (AI) playing against and defeating humans, such as AlphaStar in the video game  StarCraft II , AlphaGo in the board game Go, Deep Blue in chess, and Watson on the television game show  Jeopardy! .\n",
      " History  [  edit  ]  \n",
      "Development on the algorithms used for the bots began in November 2016. OpenAI decided to use  Dota 2 , a competitive five-on-five video game, as a base due to it being popular on the live streaming platform Twitch, having native support for Linux, and had an application programming interface (API) available. [1]  Before becoming a team of five, the first public demonstration occurred at The International 2017 in August, the annual premiere championship tournament for the game, where Dendi, a Ukrainian professional player, lost against an OpenAI bot in a live one-on-one matchup. [2]   [3]  After the match, CTO Greg Brockman explained that the bot had learned by playing against itself for two weeks of real time, and that the learning software was a step in the direction of creating software that can handle complex tasks \"like being a surgeon\". [4]   [5]  OpenAI used a methodology called reinforcement learning, as the bots learn over time by playing against itself hundreds of times a day for months, in which they are rewarded for actions such as killing an enemy and destroying towers. [6]   [7]   [8] \n",
      " By June 2018, the ability of the bots expanded to play together as a full team of five and were able to defeat teams of amateur and semi-professional players. [9]   [6]   [10]   [11]  At The International 2018, OpenAI Five played in two games against professional teams, one against the Brazilian-based paiN Gaming and the other against an all-star team of former Chinese players. [12]   [13]  Although the bots lost both matches, OpenAI still considered it a successful venture, stating that playing against some of the best players in Dota 2 allowed them to analyze and adjust their algorithms for future games. [14]  The bots' final public demonstration occurred in April 2019, where they won a best-of-three series against The International 2018 champions OG at a live event in San Francisco. [15]  A four-day online event to play against the bots, open to the public, occurred the same month. [16]  There, the bots played in 42,729 public games, winning 99.4% of those games. [17] \n",
      " Architecture  [  edit  ]  \n",
      "Each OpenAI Five bot is a neural network containing a single layer with a 4096-unit LSTM  [18]  that observes the current game state extracted from the Dota developer's API. The neural network conducts actions via numerous possible action heads (no human data involved), and every head has meaning. For instance, the number of ticks to delay an action, what action to select – the X or Y coordinate of this action in a grid around the unit. In addition, action heads are computed independently. The AI system observes the world as a list of 20,000 numbers and takes an action by conducting a list of eight enumeration values. Also, it selects different actions and targets to understand how to encode every action and observe the world. [19] \n",
      " OpenAI Five has been developed as a general-purpose reinforcement learning training system on the \"Rapid\" infrastructure. Rapid consists of two layers: it spins up thousands of machines and helps them ‘talk’ to each other and a second layer runs software. By 2018, OpenAI Five had played around 180 years worth of games in reinforcement learning running on 256 GPUs and 128,000 CPU cores, [20]  using Proximal Policy Optimization, a policy gradient method.

      " Comparisons with other game AI systems  [  edit  ]  \n",
      "Prior to OpenAI Five, other AI versus human experiments and systems have been successfully used before, such as  Jeopardy!  with Watson, chess with Deep Blue, and Go with AlphaGo. [22]   [23]   [24]  In comparison with other games that have used AI systems to play against human players, Dota 2 differs as explained below: [19] \n",
      "  Long run view: The bots run at 30 frames per second for an average match time of 45 minutes, which results in 80,000 ticks per game. OpenAI Five observes every fourth frame, generating 20,000 moves. By comparison, chess usually ends before 40 moves, while Go ends before 150 moves.\n",
      "  Partially observed state of the game: Players and their allies can only see the map directly around them. The rest of it is covered in a fog of war which hides enemies units and their movements. Thus, playing Dota 2 requires making inferences based on this incomplete data, as well as predicting what their opponent could be doing at the same time. By comparison, Chess and Go are \"full-information games\", as they do not hide elements from the opposing player. [25] \n",
      "  Continuous action space: Each playable character in a Dota 2 game, known as a hero, can take dozens of actions that target either another unit or a position. The OpenAI Five developers allow the space into 170,000 possible actions per hero. Without counting the perpetual aspects of the game, there are an average of ~1,000 valid actions each tick. By comparison, the average number of actions in chess is 35 and 250 in Go.\n",
      "  Continuous observation space: Dota 2 is played on a large map with ten heroes, five on each team, along with dozens of buildings and non-player character (NPC) units. The OpenAI system observes the state of a game through developers’ bot API, as 20,000 numbers that constitute all information a human is allowed to get access to. A chess board is represented as about 70 lists, whereas a Go board has about 400 enumerations.\n",
      " Reception  [  edit  ]  \n",
      "OpenAI Five have received acknowledgement from the AI, tech, and video game community at large. Microsoft founder Bill Gates called it a \"big deal\", as their victories \"required teamwork and collaboration\". [8]   [26]  Chess player Garry Kasparov, who lost against the Deep Blue AI in 1997, stated that despite their losing performance at The International 2018, the bots would eventually \"get there, and sooner than expected\". [27] \n",
      " In a conversation with  MIT Technology Review , AI experts also considered OpenAI Five system as a significant achievement, as they noted that Dota 2 was an \"extremely complicated game\", so even beating non-professional players was impressive. [25]   PC Gamer  wrote that their wins against professional players was a significant event in machine learning. [28]  In contrast,  Motherboard  wrote that the victory was \"basically cheating\" due to the simplified hero pools on both sides, as well as the fact that bots were given direct access to the API, as opposed to using computer vision to interpret pixels on the screen. [29]   The Verge  wrote that the bots were evidence that the company's approach to reinforcement learning and its general philosophy about AI was \"yielding milestones\". [16] \n",
      " In 2019, DeepMind unveiled a similar bot for  Starcraft II , AlphaStar. Like OpenAI Five, AlphaStar used reinforcement learning and self-play. The Verge reported that \"the goal with this type of AI research is not just to crush humans in various games just to prove it can be done. Instead, it’s to prove that — with enough time, effort, and resources — sophisticated AI software can best humans at virtually any competitive cognitive challenge, be it a board game or a modern video game.\" They added that the DeepMind and OpenAI victories were also a testament to the power of certain uses of reinforcement learning. [30] \n",
      " It was OpenAI's hope that the technology could have applications outside of the digital realm. In 2018, they were able to reuse the same reinforcement learning algorithms and training code from OpenAI Five for Dactyl, a human-like robot hand with a neural network built to manipulate physical objects. [31]  In 2019, Dactyl solved the Rubik's Cube. [32] \n",

      "Text: We’re releasing the public beta of OpenAI Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. It consists of a growing suite of environments (from simulated robots to Atari games), and a site for comparing and reproducing results.     OpenAI Gym is compatible with algorithms written in any framework, such as Tensorflow and Theano. The environments are written in Python, but we’ll soon make them easy to use from any language. We originally built OpenAI Gym as a tool to accelerate our own RL research. We hope it will be just as useful for the broader community.    Getting started     Why RL?    Reinforcement learning (RL) is the subfield of machine learning concerned with decision making and motor control. It studies how an agent can learn how to achieve goals in a complex, uncertain environment. It’s exciting for two reasons:   RL is very general, encompassing all problems that involve making a sequence of decisions: for example, controlling a robot’s motors so that it’s able to run and jump, making business decisions like pricing and inventory management, or playing video games and board games. RL can even be applied to supervised learning problems with sequential or structured outputs.  RL algorithms have started to achieve good results in many difficult environments. RL has a long history, but until recent advances in deep learning, it required lots of problem-specific engineering. DeepMind’s Atari results, BRETT from Pieter Abbeel’s group, and AlphaGo all used deep RL algorithms which did not make too many assumptions about their environment, and thus can be applied in other settings.  However, RL research is also slowed down by two factors:   The need for better benchmarks. In supervised learning, progress has been driven by large labeled datasets like ImageNet. In RL, the closest equivalent would be a large and diverse collection of environments. However, the existing open-source collections of RL environments don’t have enough variety, and they are often difficult to even set up and use.  Lack of standardization of environments used in publications. Subtle differences in the problem definition, such as the reward function or the set of actions, can drastically alter a task’s difficulty. This issue makes it difficult to reproduce published research and compare results from different papers.  OpenAI Gym is an attempt to fix both problems.    The environments    OpenAI Gym provides a diverse suite of environments that range from easy to difficult and involve many different kinds of data. We’re starting out with the following collections:   Classic control and toy text: complete small-scale tasks, mostly from the RL literature. They’re here to get you started.  Algorithmic: perform computations such as adding multi-digit numbers and reversing sequences. One might object that these tasks are easy for a computer. The challenge is to learn these algorithms purely from examples. These tasks have the nice property that it’s easy to vary the difficulty by varying the sequence length.  Atari: play classic Atari games. We’ve integrated the Arcade Learning Environment (which has had a big impact on reinforcement learning research) in an easy-to-install form.  Board games: play Go on 9x9 and 19x19 boards. Two-player games are fundamentally different than the other settings we’ve included, because there is an adversary playing against you. In our initial release, there is a fixed opponent provided by Pachi, and we may add other opponents later (patches welcome!). We’ll also likely expand OpenAI Gym to have first-class support for multi-player games.  2D and 3D robots: control a robot in simulation. These tasks use the MuJoCo physics engine, which was designed for fast and accurate robot simulation. Included are some environments from a recent benchmark by UC Berkeley researchers (who incidentally will be joining us this summer). MuJoCo is proprietary software, but offers free trial licenses.  Over time, we plan to greatly expand this collection of environments. Contributions from the community are more than welcome. Each environment has a version number (such as  Hopper-v0 ). If we need to change an environment, we’ll bump the version number, defining an entirely new task. This ensures that results on a particular environment are always comparable.    Evaluations    We’ve made it easy to upload results to OpenAI Gym. However, we’ve opted not to create traditional leaderboards. What matters for research isn’t your score (it’s possible to overfit or hand-craft solutions to particular tasks), but instead the generality of your technique. We’re starting out by maintaining a curated list of contributions that say something interesting about algorithmic capabilities. Long-term, we want this curation to be a community effort rather than something owned by us. We’ll necessarily have to figure out the details over time, and we’d would love your help in doing so.

      "OpenAI Gym Beta\n",
      "We’re releasing the public beta of OpenAI Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. It consists of a growing suite of environments (from simulated robots to Atari games), and a site for comparing and reproducing results.\n",
      "April 27, 2016\n",
      "More resources\n",
      "* Read paper\n",
      "Environments , Games , Reinforcement learning , Robotics , Software engineering , Open source , Release , Publication\n",
      "OpenAI Gym is compatible with algorithms written in any framework, such as Tensorflow and Theano. The environments are written in Python, but we’ll soon make them easy to use from any language. We originally built OpenAI Gym as a tool to accelerate our own RL research. We hope it will be just as useful for the broader community.\n",
      "Getting started\n",
      "If you’d like to dive in right away, you can work through our tutorial. You can also help out while learning by reproducing a result.\n",
      "Why RL?\n",
      "Reinforcement learning (RL) is the subfield of machine learning concerned with decision making and motor control. It studies how an agent can learn how to achieve goals in a complex, uncertain environment. It’s exciting for two reasons:\n",
      "* RL is very general, encompassing all problems that involve making a sequence of decisions: for example, controlling a robot’s motors so that it’s able to run and jump, making business decisions like pricing and inventory management, or playing video games and board games. RL can even be applied to supervised learning problems with sequential or structured outputs.\n",
      "* RL algorithms have started to achieve good results in many difficult environments. RL has a long history, but until recent advances in deep learning, it required lots of problem-specific engineering. DeepMind’s Atari results, BRETT from Pieter Abbeel’s group, and AlphaGo all used deep RL algorithms which did not make too many assumptions about their environment, and thus can be applied in other settings.\n",
      "However, RL research is also slowed down by two factors:\n",
      "* The need for better benchmarks. In supervised learning, progress has been driven by large labeled datasets like ImageNet. In RL, the closest equivalent would be a large and diverse collection of environments. However, the existing open-source collections of RL environments don’t have enough variety, and they are often difficult to even set up and use.\n",
      "* Lack of standardization of environments used in publications. Subtle differences in the problem definition, such as the reward function or the set of actions, can drastically alter a task’s difficulty. This issue makes it difficult to reproduce published research and compare results from different papers.\n",
      "OpenAI Gym is an attempt to fix both problems.\n",
      "The environments\n",
      "OpenAI Gym provides a diverse suite of environments that range from easy to difficult and involve many different kinds of data. We’re starting out with the following collections:\n",
      "* Classic control and toy text: complete small-scale tasks, mostly from the RL literature. They’re here to get you started.\n",
      "* Algorithmic: perform computations such as adding multi-digit numbers and reversing sequences. One might object that these tasks are easy for a computer. The challenge is to learn these algorithms purely from examples. These tasks have the nice property that it’s easy to vary the difficulty by varying the sequence length.\n",
      "* Atari: play classic Atari games. We’ve integrated the Arcade Learning Environment (which has had a big impact on reinforcement learning research) in an easy-to-install form.\n",
      "* Board games: play Go on 9x9 and 19x19 boards. Two-player games are fundamentally different than the other settings we’ve included, because there is an adversary playing against you. In our initial release, there is a fixed opponent provided by Pachi, and we may add other opponents later (patches welcome!). We’ll also likely expand OpenAI Gym to have first-class support for multi-player games.\n",
      "* 2D and 3D robots: control a robot in simulation. These tasks use the MuJoCo physics engine, which was designed for fast and accurate robot simulation. Included are some environments from a recent benchmark by UC Berkeley researchers (who incidentally will be joining us this summer). MuJoCo is proprietary software, but offers free trial licenses.\n",
      "Over time, we plan to greatly expand this collection of environments. Contributions from the community are more than welcome.\n",
      "Each environment has a version number (such as Hopper-v0). If we need to change an environment, we’ll bump the version number, defining an entirely new task. This ensures that results on a particular environment are always comparable.\n",
      "Evaluations\n",
      "We’ve made it easy to upload results to OpenAI Gym. However, we’ve opted not to create traditional leaderboards. What matters for research isn’t your score (it’s possible to overfit or hand-craft solutions to particular tasks), but instead the generality of your technique.\n",
      "We’re starting out by maintaining a curated list of contributions that say something interesting about algorithmic capabilities. Long-term, we want this curation to be a community effort rather than something owned by us. We’ll necessarily have to figure out the details over time, and we’d would love your help in doing so.\n",
      "We want OpenAI Gym to be a community effort from the beginning. We’ve starting working with partners to put together resources around OpenAI Gym:\n",
      "* NVIDIA: technical Q&A with John.\n",
      "* Nervana: implementation of a DQN OpenAI Gym agent.\n",
      "* Amazon Web Services (AWS): $250 credit vouchers for select OpenAI Gym users. If you have an evaluation demonstrating the promise of your algorithm and are resource-constrained from scaling it up, ping us for a voucher. (While supplies last!)\n",

      "Text: Given a learning algorithm capable of handling long horizons, we still need to explore the environment. Even with ourÂ restrictions, there are hundreds of items, dozens of buildings, spells, and unit types, and a long tail of game mechanics to learn aboutâmany of which yield powerful combinations. Itâs not easy to explore this combinatorially-vast spaceÂ efficiently. OpenAI Five learns from self-play (starting from random weights), which provides a natural curriculum for exploring the environment. To avoid âstrategy collapseâ, the agent trains 80% of its games against itself and the other 20% against its past selves. In the first games, the heroes walk aimlessly around the map. After several hours of training, concepts such asÂ laning,Â farming, or fighting overÂ midÂ emerge. After several days, they consistently adopt basic human strategies: attempt to stealÂ BountyÂ runes from their opponents, walk to theirÂ tier oneÂ towers to farm, and rotate heroes around the map to gain lane advantage. And with further training, they become proficient at high-level strategies likeÂ 5-heroÂ push. In March 2017, our firstÂ agentÂ defeated bots but got confused against humans. To force exploration in strategy space, during training (and only during training) we randomized the properties (health, speed, start level, etc.) of the units, and it began beating humans. Later on, when a test player was consistently beating our 1v1 bot, we increased our training randomizations and the test player started to lose. (Our robotics team concurrently applied similar randomization techniques toÂ physicalÂ robotsÂ to transfer from simulation to the realÂ world.) OpenAI Five uses the randomizations we wrote for our 1v1 bot. It also uses a new âlane assignmentâ one. At the beginning of each training game, we randomly âassignâ each hero to some subset ofÂ lanesÂ and penalize it for straying from those lanes until a randomly-chosen time in theÂ game. Exploration is also helped by a good reward.Â Our rewardÂ consists mostly of metrics humans track to decide how theyâre doing in the game: net worth, kills, deaths, assists, last hits, and the like. We postprocess each agentâs reward by subtracting the other teamâs average reward to prevent the agents from finding positive-sumÂ situations. We hardcode item and skill builds (originally written for ourÂ scriptedÂ baseline), and choose which of the builds to use at random.Â CourierÂ management is also imported from the scriptedÂ baseline.   ||||I|||| Close\n",

      "Our team of five neural networks, OpenAI Five, has started to defeat amateur human teams at DotaÂ 2.\n",
      "June 25, 2018\n",
      "Dota 2 ,Â Reinforcement learning ,Â Self-play ,Â Games ,Â Software engineering ,Â OpenAI Five\n",
      "Our team of five neural networks, OpenAI Five, has started toÂ defeatÂ amateur human teams atÂ Dota 2. While today we play withÂ restrictions, we aim to beat a team of top professionals atÂ The InternationalÂ in August subject only to a limited set of heroes. We may not succeed: Dota 2 is one of the most popular andÂ complexÂ esports games in the world, with creative and motivated professionals whoÂ trainÂ year-round to earn part of Dotaâs annualÂ $40MÂ prize poolÂ (the largest of any esportsÂ game).\n",
      "OpenAI Five plays 180 years worth of games against itself every day, learning via self-play. It trains using a scaled-up version ofÂ Proximal Policy OptimizationÂ running on 256 GPUs and 128,000 CPU coresâa larger-scale version of the system we built to play the much-simplerÂ solo variantÂ of the game last year. Using a separateÂ LSTMÂ for each hero and no human data, it learns recognizable strategies. This indicates thatÂ reinforcement learningÂ can yield long-term planning with large but achievable scaleâwithout fundamental advances, contrary to our own expectations upon starting theÂ project.\n",
      "To benchmark our progress, weâll host a match versus top players on August 5th.Â FollowÂ us on Twitch to view the live broadcast, orÂ requestÂ an invite to attend inÂ person!\n",
      "Play video\n",
      "The problem\n",
      "One AI milestone is to exceed human capabilities in a complex video game likeÂ StarCraftÂ or Dota. Relative to previous AI milestones likeÂ ChessÂ orÂ Go, complex video games start to capture the messiness and continuous nature of the real world. The hope is that systems which solve complex video games will be highly general, with applications outside ofÂ games.\n",
      "Dota 2 is a real-time strategy game played between two teams of five players, with each player controlling a character called a âheroâ. A Dota-playing AI must master theÂ following:\n",
      "* Long time horizons.Â Dota games run at 30 frames per second for an average of 45 minutes, resulting in 80,000 ticks per game. Most actions (like ordering a hero toÂ moveÂ to a location) have minor impact individually, but some individual actions likeÂ town portalÂ usage can affect the game strategically; someÂ strategiesÂ can play out over an entire game. OpenAI Five observes every fourth frame, yielding 20,000 moves.Â ChessÂ usually ends before 40 moves,Â GoÂ before 150 moves, with almost every move beingÂ strategic.\n",
      "* Partially-observed state.Â Units and buildings can only see the area around them. The rest of the map is covered in a fog hiding enemies and their strategies. Strong play requires making inferences based on incomplete data, as well as modeling what oneâs opponent might be up to. Both chess and Go are full-informationÂ games.\n",
      "* High-dimensional, continuous action space.Â In Dota, each hero can take dozens of actions, and many actions target either another unit or a position on the ground. We discretize the space into 170,000 possible actions per hero (not all valid each tick, such as using a spell onÂ cooldown); not counting the continuous parts, there are an average of ~1,000 valid actions each tick. The averageÂ number of actionsÂ in chess is 35; in Go,Â 250.\n",
      "* High-dimensional, continuous observation space.Â Dota is played on a large continuousÂ mapÂ containing ten heroes, dozens of buildings, dozens ofÂ NPCÂ units, and a long tail of game features such as runes, trees, and wards. Our model observes the state of a Dota game via ValveâsÂ Bot APIÂ as 20,000 (mostly floating-point) numbers representing all information a human is allowed to access. A chess board is naturally represented as about 70 enumeration values (a 8x8 board of 6 piece types and minorÂ historicalÂ info); a Go board as about 400 enumeration values (a 19x19 board of 2 piece types plusÂ Ko).\n",
      "The Dota rules are also very complex â the game has been actively developed for over a decade, with game logic implemented in hundreds of thousands of lines of code. This logic takes milliseconds per tick to execute, versus nanoseconds for Chess or Go engines. The game also gets an update about once every two weeks, constantly changing the environmentÂ semantics.\n",
      "Our approach\n",
      "Our system learns using a massively-scaled version ofÂ Proximal Policy Optimization. Both OpenAI Five and our earlierÂ 1v1 botÂ learn entirely from self-play. They start with random parameters and do not useÂ searchÂ or bootstrap from humanÂ replays.\n",

      "Batches per minute ~20 ~60\n",
      "RL researchers (including ourselves) have generallyÂ believedÂ that long time horizons would require fundamentally new advances, such asÂ hierarchicalÂ reinforcementÂ learning. Our results suggest that we havenât been giving todayâs algorithms enough credit â at least when theyâre run at sufficient scale and with a reasonable way ofÂ exploring.\n",
      "Our agent is trained to maximize the exponentially decayed sum of future rewards, weighted by an exponential decay factor calledÂ Î³. During the latest training run of OpenAI Five, we annealedÂ Î³Â fromÂ 0.998Â (valuing future rewards with a half-life of 46 seconds) toÂ 0.9997Â (valuing future rewards with a half-life of five minutes). For comparison, the longest horizon in theÂ PPOÂ paper was a half-life of 0.5 seconds, the longest in theÂ RainbowÂ paper was a half-life of 4.4 seconds, and theÂ Observe and Look FurtherÂ paper used a half-life of 46Â seconds.\n",
      "While the current version of OpenAI Five is weak atÂ last-hittingÂ (observing our test matches, the professional Dota commentatorÂ BlitzÂ estimated it around median for Dota players), itsÂ objective prioritizationÂ matches a common professional strategy. Gaining long-term rewards such as strategic map control often requires sacrificing short-term rewards such as gold gained fromÂ farming, since grouping up to attack towers takes time. This observation reinforces our belief that the system is truly optimizing over a longÂ horizon.\n",
      "OpenAI Five: Dota Gamplay 4:20\n",
      "Model structure\n",
      "Each ofÂ OpenAI Fiveâs networksÂ contain a single-layer, 1024-unitÂ LSTMÂ that sees the current game state (extracted from ValveâsÂ Bot API) and emits actions through several possible action heads. Each head has semantic meaning, for example, the number of ticks to delay this action, which action to select, the X or Y coordinate of this action in a grid around the unit, etc. Action heads are computedÂ independently.\n",
      "Interactive demonstration of the observation space and action space used by OpenAI Five. OpenAI Five views the world as a list of 20,000 numbers, and takes an action by emitting a list of 8 enumeration values. Select different actions and targets to understand how OpenAI Five encodes each action, and how it observes the world. The image shows the scene as a human would seeÂ it.\n",
      "OpenAI Five can react to missing pieces of state that correlate with what it does see. For example, until recently OpenAI Fiveâs observations did not includeÂ shrapnelÂ zones (areas where projectiles rain down on enemies), which humans see on screen. However, we observed OpenAI Five learning to walk out of (though not avoid entering) active shrapnel zones, since it could see its healthÂ decreasing.\n",
      "Exploration\n",
      "Given a learning algorithm capable of handling long horizons, we still need to explore the environment. Even with ourÂ restrictions, there are hundreds of items, dozens of buildings, spells, and unit types, and a long tail of game mechanics to learn aboutâmany of which yield powerful combinations.

      "Coordination\n",
      "OpenAI Five does not contain an explicit communication channel between the heroesâ neural networks. Teamwork is controlled by a hyperparameter we dubbed âteam spiritâ. Team spirit ranges from 0 to 1, putting a weight on how much each of OpenAI Fiveâs heroes should care about its individual reward function versus the average of the teamâs reward functions. We anneal its value from 0 to 1 overÂ training.\n",
      "Rapid\n",
      "Our system is implemented as a general-purpose RL training system called Rapid, which can be applied to anyÂ GymÂ environment. Weâve used Rapid to solve other problems at OpenAI, includingÂ CompetitiveÂ Self-Play.\n",
      "The training system is separated intoÂ rolloutÂ workers, which run a copy of the game and an agent gathering experience, andÂ optimizerÂ nodes, which perform synchronous gradient descent across a fleet of GPUs. The rollout workers sync their experience through Redis to the optimizers. Each experiment also contains workers evaluating the trained agent versus reference agents, as well as monitoring software such asÂ TensorBoard,Â Sentry, andÂ Grafana.\n",
      "During synchronous gradient descent, each GPU computes a gradient on its part of the batch, and then the gradients are globally averaged. We originally usedÂ MPIâsÂ allreduceÂ for averaging, but now use our ownÂ NCCL2Â wrappers that parallelize GPU computations and network data transfer.\n",
      "The latencies for synchronizing 58MB of data (size of OpenAI Fiveâs parameters) across different numbers of GPUs are shown on the right. The latency is low enough to be largely masked by GPU computation which runs in parallel withÂ it.\n",
      "Weâve implemented Kubernetes, Azure, and GCP backends forÂ Rapid.\n",
      "The games\n",
      "Thus far OpenAI Five has played (with ourÂ restrictions) versus each of theseÂ teams:\n",
      "1. Best OpenAI employee team: 2.5kÂ MMRÂ (46thÂ percentile)\n",
      "2. Best audience players watching OpenAI employee match (including Blitz, who commentated the first OpenAI employee match): 4â6k MMR (90th-99th percentile), though theyâd never played as aÂ team.\n",
      "3. Valve employee team: 2.5â4k MMR (46th-90thÂ percentile).\n",
      "4. Amateur team: 4.2k MMR (93rd percentile), trains as aÂ team.\n",
      "5. Semi-pro team: 5.5k MMR (99th percentile), trains as aÂ team.\n",
      "The April 23rd version of OpenAI Five was the first to beat our scripted baseline. The May 15th version of OpenAI Five was evenly matched versus team 1, winning one game and losing another. The June 6th version of OpenAI Five decisively won all its games versus teams 1â3. We set up informalÂ scrimsÂ with teams 4 & 5, expecting to lose soundly, but OpenAI Five won two of its first three games versusÂ both.\n",
      "The teamwork aspect of the bot was just overwhelming. It feels like five selfless players that know a good general strategy.\n",
      "Blitz\n",
      "We observed that OpenAIÂ Five:\n",
      "* Repeatedly sacrificed its ownÂ safe laneÂ (top lane for dire; bottom lane for radiant) in exchange for controlling the enemyâs safe lane, forcing the fight onto the side that is harder for their opponent to defend. This strategy emerged in the professional scene in the last few years, and is now considered to be the prevailing tactic. Blitz commented that he only learned this after eight years of play, whenÂ Team LiquidÂ told him aboutÂ it.\n",
      "* Pushed theÂ transitionsÂ from early- to mid-game faster than its opponents. It did this by: (1) setting up successfulÂ ganksÂ (when players move around the map to ambush an enemy heroâsee animation) when players overextended in their lane, and (2) by grouping up to take towers before the opponents could organize aÂ counterplay.\n",
      "* Deviated from currentÂ playstyleÂ in a few areas, such as givingÂ supportÂ heroes (which usually do not take priority for resources) lots of early experience and gold. OpenAI Fiveâs prioritization allows for its damage to peak sooner and push its advantage harder, winning team fights and capitalizing on mistakes to ensure a fastÂ win.\n",
      "Trophies awarded after the match between the best players at OpenAI and our bot team. One trophy for the humans, one trophy for the bots (represented by Susan Zhang from our team!)\n",
      "Differences versus humans\n",
      "OpenAI Five is given access to the same information as humans, but instantly sees data like positions, healths, and item inventories that humans have to check manually. Our method isnât fundamentally tied to observing state, but just rendering pixels from the game would require thousands ofÂ GPUs.\n",
      "OpenAI Five averages around 150-170 actions per minute (and has a theoretical maximum of 450 due to observing every 4th frame). Frame-perfect timing, whileÂ possibleÂ for skilled players, is trivial for OpenAI Five. OpenAI Five has an average reaction time of 80ms, which is faster thanÂ humans.\n",
      "These differences matter most in 1v1 (where our bot had a reaction time of 67ms), but the playing field is relatively equitable as weâve seen humans learn from and adapt to the bot. Dozens ofÂ professionalsÂ usedÂ our 1v1 bot forÂ trainingÂ in the months after last yearâsÂ TI. According to Blitz, the 1v1 bot has changed the way people think about 1v1s (the bot adopted a fast-paced playstyle, and everyone has now adapted to keepÂ up).\n",
      "Surprising findings\n",
      "* Binary rewards can give good performance.Â Our 1v1 model had a shaped reward, including rewards for last hits, kills, and the like. We ran an experiment where we only rewarded the agent for winning or losing, and it trained an order of magnitude slower and somewhat plateaued in the middle, in contrast to the smooth learning curves we usually see. The experiment ran on 4,500 cores and 16 k80 GPUs, training to the level of semi-pros (70Â TrueSkill) rather than 90 TrueSkill of our best 1v1Â bot).\n",
      "* Creep blocking can be learned from scratch.Â For 1v1, we learnedÂ creep blockingÂ using traditional RL with a âcreep blockâ reward. One of our team members left a 2v2 model training when he went on vacation (proposing to his now wife!), intending to see how much longer training would boost performance. To his surprise, the model hadÂ learned to creep blockÂ without any special guidance orÂ reward.\n",
      "* Weâre still fixing bugs.Â The chart shows a training run of the code that defeated amateur players, compared to a version where we simply fixed a number of bugs, such as rare crashes during training, or a bug which resulted in a large negative reward for reaching level 25. It turns out itâs possible to beat good humans while still hiding seriousÂ bugs!\n",
      "A subset of the OpenAI Dota team, holding the laptop that defeated the worldâs top professionals at Dota 1v1 at The International last year.*\n",
      "Whatâs next\n",
      "Our team is focused on making our August goal. We donât know if it will be achievable, but we believe that with hard work (and some luck) we have a realÂ shot.\n",
      "This post described a snapshot of our system as of June 6th. Weâll release updates along the way to surpassing human performance and write a report on our final system once we complete the project. Please join us on August 5thÂ virtuallyÂ orÂ in person, when weâll play a team of topÂ players!\n",
      "Our underlying motivation reaches beyond Dota. Real-world AI deployments will need to deal with theÂ challengesÂ raised by Dota which are not reflected in Chess, Go, Atari games, or Mujoco benchmark tasks. Ultimately, we will measure the success of our Dota system in its application to real-world tasks. If youâd like to be part of what comes next, weâreÂ hiring!\n",

      "Text: Introduction     Overview   The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language, code, or images. We offer a spectrum of models with different levels of power suitable for different tasks, as well as the ability to fine-tune your own custom models. These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification.    Key concepts   We recommend completing our quickstart tutorial to get acquainted with key concepts through a hands-on, interactive example.   Quickstart tutorial Learn by building a quick sample application     Prompts    Designing your prompt is essentially how you “program” the model, usually by providing some instructions or a few examples. This is different from most other NLP services which are designed for a single task, such as sentiment classification or named entity recognition. Instead, the completions and chat completions endpoint can be used for virtually any task including content or code generation, summarization, expansion, conversation, creative writing, style transfer, and more.   Tokens   Our models understand and process text by breaking it down into tokens. Tokens can be words or just chunks of characters. For example, the word “hamburger” gets broken up into the tokens “ham”, “bur” and “ger”, while a short and common word like “pear” is a single token. Many tokens start with a whitespace, for example “ hello” and “ bye”. The number of tokens processed in a given API request depends on the length of both your inputs and outputs. As a rough rule of thumb, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words for English text. One limitation to keep in mind is that your text prompt and generated completion combined must be no more than the model's maximum context length (for most models this is 2048 tokens, or about 1500 words). Check out our tokenizer tool to learn more about how text translates to tokens.   Models   The API is powered by a set of models with different capabilities and price points. GPT-4 is our latest and most powerful model. GPT-3.5-Turbo is the model that powers ChatGPT and is optimized for conversational formats. To learn more about these models and what else we offer, visit our models documentation.    Next steps    Keep our usage policies in mind as you start building your application.

      " OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory consisting of the non-profit OpenAI Incorporated and its for-profit subsidiary corporation OpenAI Limited Partnership. OpenAI conducts AI research with the declared intention of promoting and developing a friendly AI. OpenAI systems run on an Azure-based supercomputing platform from Microsoft. [6]   [7]   [8] \n",
      " OpenAI was founded in 2015 by Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, Jessica Livingston, John Schulman, Pamela Vagata, and Wojciech Zaremba, with Sam Altman and Elon Musk serving as the initial board members. [9]   [2]   [10]  Microsoft provided OpenAI LP with a $1 billion investment in 2019 and a $10 billion investment in 2023. [11]   [12] \n",
      "History[edit]\n",
      "2015–2018: Non-profit beginnings[edit]\n",
      "In December 2015, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research announced [13]  the formation of OpenAI and pledged over $1 billion to the venture. The organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public. [14]   [15]  OpenAI is headquartered at the Pioneer Building in Mission District, San Francisco. [16]   [4] \n",
      " According to  Wired , Brockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"founding fathers\" of the deep learning movement, and drew up a list of the \"best researchers in the field\". [17]  Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015. [17]  In 2016, OpenAI paid corporate-level (rather than nonprofit-level) salaries, but did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google. [17] \n",
      " Microsoft's Peter Lee stated that the cost of a top AI researcher exceeds the cost of a top NFL quarterback prospect. [17]  OpenAI's potential and mission drew these researchers to the firm; a Google employee said he was willing to leave Google for OpenAI \"partly because of the very strong group of people and, to a very large extent, because of its mission.\" [17]  Brockman stated that \"the best thing that I could imagine doing was moving humanity closer to building real AI in a safe way.\" [17]  OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba stated that he turned down \"borderline crazy\" offers of two to three times his market value to join OpenAI instead. [17] \n",
      " In April 2016, OpenAI released a public beta of \"OpenAI Gym\", its platform for reinforcement learning research. [18]  In December 2016, OpenAI released \"Universe\", a software platform for measuring and training an AI's general intelligence across the world's supply of games, websites, and other applications. [19]   [20]   [21]   [22] \n",
      " In 2017 OpenAI spent $7.9 million, or a quarter of its functional expenses, on cloud computing alone. [23]  In comparison, DeepMind's total expenses in 2017 were $442 million. In summer 2018, simply training OpenAI's Dota 2 bots required renting 128,000 CPUs and 256 GPUs from Google for multiple weeks.\n",
      " In 2018, Musk resigned his board seat, citing \"a potential future conflict [of interest]\" with his role as CEO of Tesla due to Tesla's AI development for self-driving cars.  [24]  Sam Altman claims that Musk believed OpenAI had fallen behind other players like Google and Musk proposed instead to take over OpenAI himself, which the board rejected. Musk subsequently left OpenAI but claimed to remain a donor, yet made no donations after his departure. [25] \n",
      "2019: Transition to for-profit[edit]\n",
      "In 2019, OpenAI transitioned from non-profit to \"capped\" for-profit, with the profit capped at 100 times any investment. [26]  According to OpenAI, the capped-profit model allows OpenAI LP to legally attract investment from venture funds, and in addition, to grant employees stakes in the company, the goal being that they can say \"I'm going to OpenAI, but in the long term it's not going to be disadvantageous to us as a family.\" [27]  Many top researchers work for Google Brain, DeepMind, or Facebook, which offer stock options that a nonprofit would be unable to. [28]  Prior to the transition, public disclosure of the compensation of top employees at OpenAI was legally required. [29] \n",
      " The company then distributed equity to its employees and partnered with Microsoft, [30]  announcing an investment package of $1 billion into the company. OpenAI also announced its intention to commercially license its technologies. [31]  OpenAI plans to spend the $1 billion\n",

      "Text: GPT-4 can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general knowledge and problem solving abilities.    Tabs    GPT-4 is more creative and collaborative than ever before. It can generate, edit, and iterate with users on creative and technical writing tasks, such as composing songs, writing screenplays, or learning a user’s writing style.        Explain the plot of Cinderella in a sentence where each word has to begin with the next letter in the alphabet from A to Z, without repeating any letters.                 GPT-4 surpasses ChatGPT in its advanced reasoning capabilities.     ChatGPT     Andrew is free from 11 am to 3 pm, Joanne is free from noon to 2 pm and then 3:30 pm to 5 pm.

GPT-4     Andrew is free from 11 am to 3 pm, Joanne is free from noon to 2 pm and then 3:30 pm to 5 pm. Hannah is available at noon for half an hour, and then 4 pm to 6 pm. What are some options for start times for a 30 minute meeting for Andrew, Hannah, and Joanne?                 GPT-4 outperforms ChatGPT by scoring in higher approximate percentiles among test-takers.     Uniform Bar Exam   Biology Olympiad     Following the research path from GPT, GPT-2, and GPT-3, our deep learning approach leverages more data and more computation to create increasingly sophisticated and capable language models.           We spent 6 months making GPT-4 safer and more aligned. GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 on our internal evaluations.    Safety &amp; alignment    Training with human feedback We incorporated more human feedback, including feedback submitted by ChatGPT users, to improve GPT-4’s behavior. We also worked with over 50 experts for early feedback in domains including AI safety and security. Continuous improvement from real-world use  We’ve applied lessons from real-world use of our previous models into GPT-4’s safety research and monitoring system. Like ChatGPT, we’ll be updating and improving GPT-4 at a regular cadence as more people use it.  GPT-4-assisted safety research GPT-4’s advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities expedited our safety work. We used GPT-4 to help create training data for model fine-tuning and iterate on classifiers across training, evaluations, and monitoring.      Built with GPT-4   We’ve collaborated with organizations building innovative products with GPT-4.             Duolingo             Be My Eyes             Stripe             Morgan Stanley             Khan Academy             Government of Iceland                                   More on GPT-4     Research   GPT-4 is the latest milestone in OpenAI’s effort in scaling up deep learning.     Infrastructure   GPT-4 was trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers. Azure’s AI-optimized infrastructure also allows us to deliver GPT-4 to users around the world.     Limitations   GPT-4 still has many known limitations that we are working to address, such as social biases, hallucinations, and adversarial prompts. We encourage and facilitate transparency, user education, and wider AI literacy as society adopts these models. We also aim to expand the avenues of input people have in shaping our models.     Availability   GPT-4 is available on ChatGPT Plus and as an API for developers to build applications and services.     We’re excited to see how people use GPT-4 as we work towards developing technologies that empower everyone.   ||||I|||| Close\n",
